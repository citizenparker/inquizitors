Problem - how to represent and manipulate players.

"Players" have:
  - a channel (used to send/receive messages for that player)
  - a name (used to represent this person in chat)
  - a symbol (used to represent this person in world)
  - a color (used to represent this person in world)
  - a position in the world

Any solution must account for the following scenarios where a player...
  - joins
  - exits
  - sends a chat to all players (the default)
  - moves
  - sends a private chat to another player
  - answers a trivia question that is just for them

Possible solutions
  - shared array of players stored as maps
